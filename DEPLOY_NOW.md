## 🎯 The Fastest Way (Automatic - Recommended)

### Step 1: Commit the GitHub Actions Workflow
```cmd
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git add GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOY.md
git add DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages automatic deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Done! 🎉
Your portfolio automatically deploys. Check it at: **https://karen6099.github.io**

That's it! Future updates will deploy automatically whenever you push to `main`.

## 💻 Alternative: Manual Deploy (If Node.js is installed)

### One-time setup:
```cmd
npm install
```

### Deploy command:
```cmd
npm run deploy
```
